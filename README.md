## Usage

Creates a Kinesis stream encrypted using the AWS-managed KMS key.

```hcl
module "kinesis_stream" {
  source = "dod-iac/kinesis-stream/aws"

  name = format("app-%s-%s", var.application, var.environment)
  tags = {
    Application = var.application
    Environment = var.environment
    Automation  = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

Creates a Kinesis stream encrypted using a customer-managed KMS key.

```hcl
module "kinesis_kms_key" {
  source = "dod-iac/kinesis-kms-key/aws"

  name = format("alias/app-%s-kinesis-%s", var.application, var.environment)
  description = format("A KMS key used to encrypt Kinesis stream records at rest for %s:%s.", var.application, var.environment)
  tags = {
    Application = var.application
    Environment = var.environment
    Automation  = "Terraform"
  }
}

module "kinesis_stream" {
  source = "dod-iac/kinesis-stream/aws"

  name = format("app-%s-%s", var.application, var.environment)
  kms_key_id = module.kinesis_kms_key.aws_kms_key_arn
  tags = {
    Application = var.application
    Environment = var.environment
    Automation  = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| encryption\_type | The encryption type to use. The only acceptable values are NONE or KMS. | `string` | `"KMS"` | no |
| enforce\_consumer\_deletion | A boolean that indicates all registered consumers should be deregistered from the stream so that the stream can be destroyed without error. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| kms\_key\_id | The GUID for the customer-managed KMS key to use for encryption. You can also use a Kinesis-owned master key by specifying the alias alias/aws/kinesis. | `string` | `"alias/aws/kinesis"` | no |
| name | A name to identify the stream. This is unique to the AWS account and region the Stream is created in. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| retention\_period | Length of time data records are accessible after they are added to the stream. | `number` | `24` | no |
| shard\_count | The number of shards that the stream will use. | `number` | `1` | no |
| shard\_level\_metrics | A list of shard-level CloudWatch metrics which can be enabled for the stream. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| tags | Tags applied to the Kinesis stream. | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| arn | The ARN of the Kinesis stream |
